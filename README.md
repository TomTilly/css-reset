# Tilly's CSS Reset

This is my simple CSS "reset", which is a mix between [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) and [Josh Comeau's](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) awesome resets, with a sprinkle of my own rules. I don't really think of it as a reset, but more like base styles that I include in every project.

Given that I include it in every project, I try to keep out opinionated styles that are likely to be changed anyway. `line-height`, for instance, is dependent on the design and `font-family` for the current project, so I've omitted it from the `body`.
